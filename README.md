# Task List
This is a small CLI program to manage a todo.txt

## Description
I wrote this program so I can quickly write down tasks I have coming up. When I used Windows I used the sticky notes but it wasn't efficient. It can manage date times and task descriptions. Currently only kind of supports up to 100 entries since some functions are written with these numbers in mind. Because let's be honest if you have more than a hundred tasks to write down you should you something more feature rich program to manage it.
